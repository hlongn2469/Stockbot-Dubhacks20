## About
This is a project created during dubhacks/hackathon, which uses Discord.py API. Inspired by many stock trading platforms, we wanted to create an easier way for users to learn about the stock market, especially during these boring times of the COVID-19 epicdemic. This is a good time to invest and learn about stocks.

**Problem** - Bored during COVID-19 and this is a good time to learn about and invest in stocks. Build a learning platform via discord and web app (canvas + blueprint). 

**Audience** - Teenagers/young adults who wants to learn about stocks through experience with fake money (HAS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH DISCORD) 

We chose to use Discord.py as our tool because we want to use it as our first step approch to displaying data. We plan on moving to HTML5/Mobile App later in the future.

## Feature
Our team's main focus is to prioritize simplicity and organization as much as possible using Discord commands.
- Buy/Sell stocks
- Display basic info about a stock
- Look at specific info about a stock
- Display detailed info about a stock

## Research
**Introduction**
The stock market is made up of exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Stocks are listed on a specific exchange, which brings buyers and sellers together and acts as a market for the shares of those stocks. The exchange tracks the supply and demand — and directly related, the price — of each stock.
But this isn’t your typical market, and you can’t show up and pick your shares off a shelf the way you select produce at the grocery store. Individual traders are typically represented by brokers — these days, that’s often an online broker. You place your stock trades through the broker, which then deals with the exchange on your behalf. (Broker you should use for Beginner : ( Robinhood, TD American, Acorn,.. )
The NYSE and the Nasdaq are open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern, with premarket and after-hours trading sessions also available, depending on your broker. 

**Stock Performance**
When people refer to the stock market being up or down, they’re generally referring to one of the major market indexes.
A market index tracks the performance of a group of stocks, which either represents the market as a whole or a specific sector of the market, like technology or retail companies. You’re likely to hear most about the S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; they are often used as proxies for the performance of the overall market.
Investors use indexes to benchmark the performance of their own portfolios and, in some cases, to inform their stock trading decisions. You can also invest in an entire index through index funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which track a specific index or sector of the market.

**Understand about the stock market** 
Most investors would be well-advised to build a diversified portfolio of stocks or stock index funds and hold on to it through good times and bad. But investors who like a little more action engage in stock trading. Stock trading involves buying and selling stocks frequently in an attempt to time the market.
The goal of stock traders is to capitalize on short-term market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks at a low. Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout the day. Others are simply active traders, placing a dozen or more trades per month. (Interested in individual stocks? View our list of the best-performing stocks this year.)
Investors who trade stocks do extensive research, often devoting hours a day to following the market. They rely on technical analysis, using tools to chart a stock's movements in an attempt to find trading opportunities and trends. Many online brokers offer stock trading information, including analyst reports, stock research and charting tools.

**Bull and Bear Market**
Neither is an animal you’d want to run into on a hike, but the market has picked the bear as the true symbol of fear: A Bear market  means stock prices are falling — thresholds vary, but generally to the tune of 20% or more — across several of the indexes referenced earlier. Bull markets are followed by bear markets, and vice versa, with both often signaling the start of larger economic patterns. In other words, a bull market typically means investors are confident, which indicates economic growth. A bear market shows investors are pulling back, indicating the economy may do so as well.
The good news is that the average bull market far outlasts the average bear market, which is why over the long term you can grow your money by investing in stocks.
The S&P 500, which holds around 500 of the largest stocks in the U.S.,historical return 7% per year , when you factor in reinvested dividends and adjust for inflation. That means if you invested $1,000 30 years ago, you could have around $7,600 today. 
Stock Market Cash and Correction  

**Stock Crash**
A stock market correction happens when the stock market drops by 10% or more. A stock crash is a sudden, very sharp drop in stock prices, like in October 1987 when stocks plunged 23% in a single day. Or 6 months ago, when the Dow Jones dropped 46% in April. While crashes can herald a bear market, remember what we mentioned above: Most bull markets last longer than bear markets — which means stock markets tend to rise in value over time. If you're worried about a crash, it helps to focus on the long term. When the stock market declines, it can be difficult to watch your portfolio’s value shrink in real time and do nothing about it. However, if you’re investing for the long term, doing nothing is often the best course.
